# **AutoNLS**
Automated Non-Linear Systems/Structures and Exploratory Data Analysis in R

---

## **Overview**

AutoNLS is an R package designed to streamline non-linear regression modeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. With support for a variety of non-linear models, automated evaluation, scoring, and GAM-enhanced scatterplot visualizations, AutoNLS empowers users to handle complex modeling tasks with ease.

---

## **Key Features**

- **Non-Linear Regression**:
  - Supports a wide variety of non-linear models (e.g., Hill Equation, Logistic Growth).
  - Automatic model fitting and selection.
  - Cross-validation for model evaluation.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Automated correlation analysis (Pearson vs. Spearman).
  - Interactive visualizations using `echarts4r`.
  - Pairwise scatterplots with GAM (Generalized Additive Model) fits.

- **Visualization**:
  - Comparison of model shapes and fits.
  - Scatterplots with dynamic GAM smoothing lines.
  - Comprehensive interactive plots powered by `echarts4r`.

- **Scoring and Prediction**:
  - Score new datasets using fitted non-linear models.
  - Visualize predictions interactively.

## **Installation**

### From GitHub

To install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# Install devtools if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Install AutoNLS
devtools::install_github("AdrianAntico/AutoNLS")
```

To run the Shiny app, ensure you have the following packages installed:
`shiny`, `bs4Dash`, `bslib`, and `DT`.

You can install them using:
```R
install.packages(c("shiny", "bs4Dash", "bslib", "DT"))
```

## Shiny App Usage (code usage below)

### AutoNLS Shiny App
The AutoNLS Shiny App is an interactive, user-friendly interface built on top of the AutoNLS package. The app simplifies the process of exploring datasets, fitting non-linear regression models, and visualizing results without needing to write any code. Itâ€™s ideal for analysts, researchers, and data enthusiasts who prefer a GUI-based approach.

Features of the Shiny App:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize variable distributions with customizable bin sizes and themes.
Compute and display correlation matrices.
Explore pairwise relationships with scatterplots and generalized additive model (GAM) fits.
Model Fitting:

Select and fit multiple non-linear regression models to your data.
Evaluate model metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).
Visualize model fits and compare them side-by-side.
Scoring:

Use fitted models to generate predictions for new datasets.
Compare scoring plots for multiple models on unseen data.
Customization:

Choose from a wide variety of themes for plots.
Interactively select variables and adjust model parameters.
How to Run the Shiny App
Install the package (if not already installed):

```r
run_shiny_app()
```

Interact with the app:

Use the sidebar to navigate between EDA, Model Fitting, and Scoring pages.
Upload your dataset in CSV format and follow the prompts to generate insights and models.

Example Walkthrough:
EDA Page:

Upload a dataset (e.g., dummy_data.csv).
Explore variable distributions, compute correlations, and generate scatterplots.
Model Fitting Page:

Select predictor (X-Value) and target (Target) variables.
Choose models to fit (e.g., Hill, Logistic).
View model metrics and plots.
Scoring Page:

Upload new data for scoring.
Generate scoring plots to evaluate predictions.

## Code Usage

### Step 1: Load the Data

First, we load the example dataset dummy_data.csv included with the package.

```r
library(data.table)

# Load the dummy dataset
file_path <- system.file("extdata", "dummy_data.csv", package = "AutoNLS")
dummy_data <- fread(file_path)

# Display the first few rows
print(dummy_data)
```

### Step 2: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We use the EDA class to compute correlations and create visualizations.

```r
# Initialize EDA
eda <- EDA$new(dummy_data)

# Correlation analysis
correlations <- eda$correlate(target_col = "Target")
print(correlations)

# Visualize distributions
distribution_plots <- eda$visualize_distributions(bins = 10)
distribution_plots[[1]]  # View the first distribution plot

# Visualize scatterplots with GAM fits
scatter_plots <- eda$visualize_scatterplots(k_values = c(3, 5, 7))
scatter_plots[[1]]  # View the first scatterplot
```

### Step 3: Fit Non-Linear Models
Next, we use the NonLinearFitter class to fit selected non-linear models to the data.

```r
# Initialize the fitter
fitter <- NonLinearFitter$new(dummy_data)

# Add models to test
fitter$add_model("Hill")
fitter$add_model("Logistic")
fitter$add_model("ExponentialDecay")

# Fit models
fit_results <- fitter$fit_models(x_col = "X-Value", y_col = "Target")

# Print summary of fit results
print(fit_results)
```

### Step 4: Evaluate Fitted Models
Use the NonLinearModelEvaluator class to evaluate fitted models and generate plots.

```r
# Initialize evaluator
evaluator <- NonLinearModelEvaluator$new(fit_results, data = dummy_data)

# Generate metrics
metrics <- evaluator$generate_metrics()
print(metrics)

# Generate comparison plots
comparison_plots <- evaluator$generate_comparison_plot(
  data = dummy_data,
  x_col = "X-Value",
  y_col = "Target"
)
comparison_plots[[1]]  # View the first comparison plot
```

### Step 5: Score New Data
We use the NonLinearModelScorer class to score new data based on the fitted models. For this example, we'll assume new_data.csv is another dataset in the same format as dummy_data.csv.

```r
# Load new data for scoring
file_path_new <- system.file("extdata", "new_data.csv", package = "AutoNLS")
new_data <- fread(file_path_new)

# Initialize the scorer
scorer <- NonLinearModelScorer$new(fit_results, new_data)

# Score new data for all models
score_results <- scorer$score_all_models()

# Print scored results
print(score_results)

# Generate scoring plots
scoring_plots <- scorer$generate_score_plot("Hill", new_data, x_col = "X-Value")
scoring_plots  # View the scoring plot for the "Hill" model
```

### Appendix: Pre-Investigation of Model Shapes
If you want to perform a pre-investigation into what the models' shapes look like for a given range of x values, you can use the model_visualizer functionality from the NonLinearFitter class. This is especially helpful for understanding the behavior of different non-linear models before fitting them to your data.

```r
# Initialize the fitter
fitter <- NonLinearFitter$new(dummy_data)

# Use model visualizer to explore model shapes
x_range <- seq(1, 100, by = 1)
plot <- fitter$model_visualizer$generate_comparison_plot(x_range = x_range)

# Display the plot
plot
```
